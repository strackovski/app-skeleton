AppSkeleton
============

### This is a web application skeleton based on CodeIgniter, Doctrine ORM, Twig and Assetic.

I use it for several of my web projects. It is supposed to ease the pain when starting a project
using a custom framework.

CodeIgniter is used because of it's micro footprint. However, lately Silex has caught my interest,
and I've been working to adapt this skeleton to Silex as well.
